The Negros Occidental High School had an Extension campus in Murcia, Negros Occidental and later on changed its name to Murcia National High School, the foundation for the establishment of a Provincial High School in Negros Occidental was already laid in 1901 by the Division Superintendent, George W. Beattie, so that when Act 372 of the Philippine Commission was passed on March 7, 1901, empowering the Provincial Boards of the country to provide funds for the erection or renting and other expenses for a secondary school in the province, Beattie was ready for implementation of the plan, including the hiring of teachers in time for the opening of the school on July 1, 1902.</p1></h3>
