            <h2>ðŸ“Œ DO YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT <B>NOHS</B>?</h2>
            <p><b>Negros Occidental High School (NOHS)</b>, located in Bacolod City, Negros Occidental, Philippines, is the oldest public secondary educational institution in the province. Established on July 1, 1902, it has a rich history spanning over a century.
            <br>
            <br>
               <b>History</b>
               <br>
            <br> 
                -Originally named Instituto Rizal, the school was founded with the efforts of former leaders of the Republica de Negros, Antonio Ledesma Jayme and Melecio Severino. They were instrumental in its establishment, with Jayme's house serving as the initial classrooms and dormitories. The first principal was Ray Howell, who led the school from 1902 to 1904. Over the years, the institution underwent several name changes, becoming Rizal Institute in 1914, Negros Occidental High School in 1921, and Bacolod High School in 1931. 
            <br>

                <b>Curriculum and Programs</b>
                <br>
            <br>
                -NOHS offers a diverse range of programs to cater to various student interests and academic pursuits. These include the Special Program in Science Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) for the Special Science Class, the Basic Education Curriculum for Regular Classes, Special Programs for the Arts and Journalism, Special Classes in Culture and Sports, and a Basic Education Curriculum for Night Classes.

                <b>Facilities and Infrastructure</b>
            <br>
            <br>
                -The school has continually developed its facilities to provide a conducive learning environment. In November 2017, NOHS inaugurated a new four-story building with 20 classrooms, accommodating approximately 1,400 senior high school students.

                <br>
            <br>
                
                -Recognized for its historical and cultural importance, NOHS was declared a National Historical Landmark by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. A historical marker installed in 2002 commemorates its legacy as the oldest public secondary school in the province.</p>
